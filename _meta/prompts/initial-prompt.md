# Project Initialization

I'm developing a game using native JavaScript without frameworks and need your assistance with architecture and implementation. I'll provide access to a GitHub repository where all work will be stored.

## Development Approach
- This project will use a token-efficient development workflow
- Core API information will be maintained in API_REFERENCE.md
- All project information will be stored in repository files, not conversation history
- After initial setup, future development sessions will start with new conversations
- Documentation must be comprehensive enough to continue work in a new conversation

## Requirements:
- All development must strictly follow the CODING_GUIDELINES.md in the repository
- All code, comments, and documentation must be in English
- Every file, function, class, and property must be well-documented according to the guidelines
- Maintain and update the following documentation files with each significant change:
    * README.md - Project overview, architecture, and file catalog
    * TODO.md - Structured task tracking with session documentation
    * CHANGELOG.md - Record of significant changes
    * DESIGN.md - Architectural decisions and patterns
    * CODING_GUIDELINES.md - Coding standards and practices
    * API_REFERENCE.md - Compact overview of all modules, functions, classes, and data schemas

## Initial Development
- Initial development will NOT use image sprites or audio files
- Use native Canvas shapes and drawing operations (rectangles, circles, lines, etc.)
- All game data must be separated from code and stored in JSON files
- Each type of game data requires documented schema and validation

## For the first session, please:
1. Review the initial CODING_GUIDELINES.md I've provided
2. Understand my game requirements (which I'll describe next)
3. Propose an initial architecture with justification in DESIGN.md
4. Create the repository structure with essential files
5. Implement a minimal viable prototype for the first milestone
6. Include simple test cases according to the guidelines
7. Document next steps in TODO.md with priorities and complexity estimates
8. Create and populate API_REFERENCE.md with initial module interfaces
9. Ensure all documentation is complete enough to continue in a new conversation
