# Development Session

Please continue development on my JavaScript game project. The repository contains all necessary information.

## Core Instructions:
1. Always review these key documentation files first:
  - API_REFERENCE.md - Compact overview of all interfaces
  - TODO.md - Current tasks and priorities
  - CHANGELOG.md - Development history

2. For the specific task, examine only the directly relevant code files

3. Implement EXACTLY ONE task from TODO.md (highest priority) unless I specify otherwise
  - Ensure it results in a stable, working build
  - If I specify a different task than what's in TODO.md, prioritize my request and update TODO.md accordingly

4. No image sprites or audio files - use only Canvas shapes and drawing operations

5. Maintain strict separation between code and data:
  - All game data in JSON files within the data/ directory
  - Each new data type must include documented schema
  - Update or create README.md in data subdirectories to explain schemas
  - Include validation for all data loading

6. Update all documentation comprehensively:
  - Update API_REFERENCE.md with any new/modified functions, classes, or data schemas
  - Update CHANGELOG.md with only the changes from THIS session
  - Mark completed tasks in TODO.md and add any new identified tasks
  - Update README.md if new files or interfaces were added
  - Update DESIGN.md with any architectural decisions

7. Provide complete file content for any changed or new files
  - Always include the entire file, ready for copy-paste

## Response Format:
1. Brief summary of the task implemented
2. Complete content of all changed/new files
3. Summary of documentation updates
4. Next recommended task(s)

After this session completes, I will start a new conversation for the next development session.
