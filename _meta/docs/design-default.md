# Design Document

## Architecture Overview

This project follows a modular architecture to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability.

### Core Components

#### Game Engine
The central component that manages the game state and logic. It coordinates between all other components but doesn't directly handle rendering or input.

#### Renderer
Handles all drawing operations, isolated from game logic to allow for different rendering approaches if needed in the future.

#### Input Manager
Manages user interactions, mapping raw inputs to game commands.

#### Asset Manager
Handles loading and caching of game assets (images, audio, etc.).

## Design Decisions

### State Management
The game uses a centralized state object that components can access but only modify through defined methods. This prevents unexpected state changes and makes debugging easier.

### Rendering Approach
Using HTML5 Canvas for rendering due to:
- Better performance for pixel-based operations
- Simplified rendering model
- Consistent behavior across browsers

### Game Loop
Implementing a fixed time step game loop to ensure:
- Consistent physics and animation regardless of frame rate
- Predictable game behavior
- Ability to scale performance on different devices

## Future Considerations

- Potential WebGL integration for more complex visual effects
- Modular sound system for dynamic audio
- Potential multiplayer capabilities
